### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Robin, a software engineer from Ghent, Belgium. I'm passionate about design & code.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at [LEGALFLY](https://www.legalfly.com/), working on legal AI as back-end engineer.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Rust & Kotlin multiplatform.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on some cool open source things with one of my favorite languages.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Go & TypeScript, web apps... and much more!
