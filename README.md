### Hi there 👋
I'm Robin, a software engineer from Ghent, Belgium. I'm passionate about design & code.
- 🔭 I’m currently working at Sinch, working on Conversational AI (chatbots) with Go, TypeScript, Node.js and React.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Haskell, Kotlin / Android, and Rust.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on some cool open source things with one of my favorite languages.
- 💬 Ask me about Go, JavaScript & TypeScript, web apps... and much more!
- 📫 How to reach me: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/robinvenneman) [Mastodon](https://mas.to/@robinv)
- 😄 Pronouns: He/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: My definition of fun often consists of a good workout session and I also do some coaching besides my work as a developer (I regularly coach classes in boxing / Thaiboxing and even some Crossfit 😄)
